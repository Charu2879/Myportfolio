        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, my name is Charuka and I'm a web developer. I've always been
          interested in technology and how things work. When I was a kid, I
          spent a lot of time taking apart computers and trying to put them back
          together. As I got older, my interest in technology grew and I decided
          to pursue a career in web development.

          In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading, and hiking. I

          programming projects outside of work.
